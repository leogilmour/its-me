      which uses "blocks" of code to solve puzzles. Great demonstration of the
      logic behind programming and how it just comes down to a bunch of rules
      that sovle a problem! Also, the 3D angled map with arrows for commands is
      a great spatial awareness task / for improving spatial maths! 27 levels!

        The paywalls that have gone up around coding resources over the past 5
        years irritate me. It is not the spirit of the web or coding. Coders are
        built on the help they have received - for free - from others. Open
        source is a founding concept behind coding and the programming
        community. Stack overflow IS the community, helping each other out for
        free. Barriers to entry in programming is a concern to me in an industry
        that is already full of stereotypes, creating systems with coded bias
        that everyone relies upon. It is also, first and foremost, a hobby that
        everyone with access to a computer should be able to enjoy. Do not feel
        the need to pay for content, there are so many resources out there that
        are free to use, and help whereever you turn. Of course, this is not to
        say that you should not a) donate / support your favourite creators
        through sites such as patreon b) be generous with your own time in the
        future. Remember how much you benefitted from the intellectual
        generoisty of others. Programming is inherently collaboartive. No one
        codes alone. Youre either looking to others for help and support or
        youre using tools that have been crafted by others before you. Even the
        language you choose to use. Foundation founding bedrock.
