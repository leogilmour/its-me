      <h1 class="tutoring">tutoring:</h1>
      <p>
        I spent my own GCSEs helping people with their maths questions on
        student forums instead of, you know, my own actual revision.
      </p>
      <p>
        I caught a bug for teaching and havenâ€™t stopped since!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience in tutoring
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>maths</li>
        <li>physics</li>
        <li>biology</li>
        <li>chemistry</li>
        <li>coding</li>
        <li>English</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and also</p>
      <ul>
        <li>revision techniques</li>
        <li>STEM interviews</li>
        <li>Oxbridge interviews and admissions tests</li>
        <li>mentoring</li>
        <li>touch typing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I collaborate with my scholars with a focus on:<br />
        building their confidence so they attempt questions that seem
        intimidating; using storytelling to imprint key concepts; demonstrating
        how to break down problems into their smaller, easier, solveable parts.
      </p>
      <p>"I'm not sure"</p>
      <p>
        Building confidence means students will have a go even if they are not
        sure it is the right answer. Simply making a start might open up the
        problem and even gain them some marks. Mistakes are the best way to
        learn after all. If a student is not making mistakes, they are either
        too afraid to get a question wrong or the material is not difficult
        enough to push them.
      </p>
      <p>"I don't know"</p>
      <p>
        The ability to admit not knowing can be a brave act. It leads to
        questions - there is no such thing as a silly question! Asking questions
        demonstrates engagement and curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>"What's the point of learning this anyway?!"</p>
      <p>
        I aim to provide a context for the material so it has a relevance for my
        scholars. At the very least, some of the more abstract topics expand
        their ways of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>"How do you know?"</p>
      <p>
        I ensure my scholars have an understanding of the first principles so
        they can derive and understand the concept themselves. Curiosity is best
        with a healthy dose of scepticism. Questioning how or why we know
        something will improve their understanding.
